# EECS 549 Final Project
When choosing a movie based off of online information, people rely on existing catalog system to filter movies by objective attributes
such as year of release, genre, and etc. However, people may look for a movie with specific elements that cannot be discovered by the aforementioned filter. We propose a movie tagging system to extract, store and present keyphrases in movie reviews, as well as
use them for indexing a movie when a keyphrase is entered into our system.
